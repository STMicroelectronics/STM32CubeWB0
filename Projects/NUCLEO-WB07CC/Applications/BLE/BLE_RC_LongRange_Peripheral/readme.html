        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>This demo shows how to control a remote device (e.g., to
        drive an actuator) using the STM32WB07 on Coded PHY (Bluetooth
        LE specifications v5.0) to reach longer distances.</p>
        <h3 id="demo-application-workflow">Demo Application
        Workflow</h3>
        <h3 id="peripheral-device-initialization">Peripheral Device
        Initialization</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Peripheral device starts by entering discoverable mode
        with a fixed address (0x0280E10000E1).</li>
        <li>LED2 blinks, indicating that the board is in advertising
        mode.</li>
        <li>LED3 is off, indicating that the board is using 1 Mbps
        PHY.</li>
        <li>Pressing PUSH1 starts a new advertisement process. Please
        note that if a Coded PHY advertisement is running, it will be
        terminated. If a connection has been successfully established
        before, it will also be terminated. If an advertisement with 1M
        PHY is running, no action will be performed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="central-device-initialization">Central Device
        Initialization</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Pressing the push button PUSH1 on the Central device
        (address 0x0280E10000E0) starts the attempt to connect to the
        Peripheral board.</li>
        <li>LED2 blinks, indicating that the Central is trying to
        connect.</li>
        <li>LED3 is off, indicating that the board is using 1 Mbps
        PHY.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="advertising-and-scanning">Advertising and Scanning</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Peripheral starts BLE advertising for 60 seconds
        initially. After this period, advertising can be restarted by
        pressing PUSH1 on the Peripheral.</li>
        <li>The Central starts the BLE scanning procedure by pressing
        PUSH1.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="connection-and-communication">Connection and
        Communication</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Once connected (LED2 remains on for both devices), the
        Central writes to a BLE characteristic to switch LED1 on and off
        on the Peripheral.</li>
        <li>The state of LED1 changes every 300 ms if all packets are
        received from the Central.</li>
        <li>The state of LED1 also changes on the Central side when the
        write to the characteristic is successful.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="measuring-communication-range">Measuring Communication
        Range</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>To measure the communication range, move the boards away
        from each other until LED1 on the Peripheral blinks at a
        constant rate. When the blinking rate of LED1 decreases, it
        indicates that several packets are being retransmitted by the
        Central, suggesting the boards are at the limit of a stable
        communication range.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="switching-phy">Switching PHY</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>While connected, press button PUSH2 on one of the boards to
        start the procedure to change the PHY to Coded PHY.</li>
        <li>When the procedure completes (i.e., Coded PHY activated), a
        message is visible on the terminal.</li>
        <li>Pressing the PUSH2 button again on the same device switches
        the PHY back to 1 Mbps.</li>
        <li>LED3 is on, indicating that the board is using the Coded
        PHY.</li>
        <li>LED3 is off, indicating that the board is using 1 Mbps
        PHY.</li>
        <li><strong>Note</strong>: When the PHY is switched by one
        device, the other device will not be able to switch the PHY.
        Once the first device sets the preferred PHY (either 1 Mbps or
        Coded), only that device will be able to continue switching
        between 1 Mbps and Coded PHY.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="measuring-range-with-coded-phy">Measuring Range with
        Coded PHY</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Users can measure the stable communication range using Coded
        PHY by repeating the test described above: move the boards away
        from each other until LED1 on the Peripheral blinks at a
        constant rate.</li>
        <li>An increased stable communication range compared to 1 Mbps
        PHY should be visible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="switching-advertising-or-scanning-phy">Switching
        Advertising or Scanning PHY</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The PUSH3 button can also be used to start BLE advertising
        on the Peripheral device or BLE scanning on the Central device
        using the Coded PHY. If a connection or an advertisement process
        is ongoing, these will terminate before starting the new
        procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On the Central device, some statistics on the link quality
        are printed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="terminal-output">Terminal Output</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Central and the Peripheral show information for each
        action status, whether success or fail.</li>
        <li>During the connection, the Central device shows the
        statistics of the radio activity every 10 seconds and will print
        one symbol * to the terminal for each packet transmitted.</li>
        </ul>
