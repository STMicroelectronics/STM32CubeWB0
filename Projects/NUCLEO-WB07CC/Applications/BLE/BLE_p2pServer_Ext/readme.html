        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting as BLE peripheral and GATT server
        and using several advertising sets.</p>
        <p>p2pServer_Ext application advertises several extended
        advertising sets:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A legacy advertising</li>
        <li>A connectable extended advertising</li>
        <li>A scannable extended advertising</li>
        <li>A non-connectable and non-scannable extended
        advertising</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These sets are configurable in file adv_ext_app.c.</p>

        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board may be necessary to run
        p2pClient_Ext application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with p2pServer_Ext application with
        a smartphone:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Install and launch ST BLE Toolbox or ST BLE Sensor
        applications on android or iOS smartphone
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">

        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with p2pServer_Ext application with
        another Nucleo board running p2pClient_Ext:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Power up p2pClient_Ext device next to a p2pServer_Ext
        device.</li>
        <li>On p2pClient_Ext device press B1 button to start scanning:
        if a p2pServer_Ext connectable extended advertising is
        discovered, BD address is registered.</li>
        <li>Then, press B3 button on p2pClient_Ext to connect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with p2pServer_Ext application with
        another Nucleo board running p2pClient:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Power up p2pClient device next to p2pServer_Ext device.</li>
        <li>On p2pClient device press B1 button to start scanning:
        p2pClient will receive legacy advertising from p2pServer_Ext and
        connect to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
