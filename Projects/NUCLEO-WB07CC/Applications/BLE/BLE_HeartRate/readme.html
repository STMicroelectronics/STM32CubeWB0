        <ul>
        <li>This example runs on STM32WB0 devices.</li>
        <li>Connect the Nucleo Board to your PC with a USB cable type A
        to USB type C to ST-LINK USB connector.</li>
        <li>This application is by default configured to support low
        power mode ( No traces - No debugger )</li>
        <li>Low Power configuration can be modified in app_conf.h
        (CFG_FULL_LOW_POWER, CFG_DEBUG_APP_TRACE)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable
        file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the Android/iOS device, enable the Bluetooth
        communications, and if not done before:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Install the ST BLE Sensor application on the Android/iOS
        device:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems">
        ST BLE Sensor Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/App/st-bluems/id993670214?mt=8">
        ST BLE Sensor iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>You can also install the ST BLE Toolbox application on the
        Android/iOS device:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">
        ST BLE Toolbox Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-toolbox/id1531295550">
        ST BLE Toolbox iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Power on the Nucleo board with the BLE_HeartRate
        application.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Then, click open ST BLE Sensor app anf select the HR_xx
        in the device list.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Heart Rate is displayed each second on the
        smartphone.</li>
        <li>Pairing is supported:
        <ul>
        <li>Button B2 clears the security database when the device is
        not connected,</li>
        <li>When connected with a client, button B2 send the slave
        pairing request, here a popup asks you to associate your
        device.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>This example supports switch to 2Mbits PHY, pressing button
        B1 while connected allows to switch between 1Mbits PHY and
        2Mbits PHY.</li>
        <li>After 60s of advertising, the application switch from fast
        advertising to low power advertising, pressing button B1 while
        advertising allows to restart fast advertising.</li>
        <li>Pressing button B3 while connected allows to update the
        connection interval.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>You can either open ST BLE Toolbox application
        (Android/iOS device).</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Select the HR_xx in the device list and connect to the
        device.</li>
        <li>Scroll right and select Heart Rate interface,</li>
        <li>HearRate and energy measurement are launched and displayed
        in graphs. You can reset the energy measurement.</li>
        <li>Pairing is supported:
        <ul>
        <li>Button B2 clears the security database when the device is
        not connected,</li>
        <li>When connected with a client, button B2 send the slave
        pairing request, here a popup asks you to associate your
        device.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>You can either bond from the smartphone by clicking on Bond
        Button.</li>
        <li>This example supports switch to 2Mbits PHY, pressing button
        B1 while connected allows to switch between 1Mbits PHY and
        2Mbits PHY.</li>
        <li>After 60s of advertising, the application switch from fast
