        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>The BLE_ApplicationInstallManager application, associated to
        a BLE application embedding OTA service, manages the firmware
        update over the air of a BLE application.</p>
        <h3 id="keywords"><strong>Keywords</strong></h3>
        <p>Connectivity, BLE, BLE protocol, BLE firmware update over the
        air, BLE profile</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The BLE_ApplicationInstallManager application must run with
        BLE applications embedding OTA service like: BLE_HeartRate_ota
        or BLE_p2pServer_ota applications.</p>
        <p><strong>BLE_ApplicationInstallManager</strong> is loaded at
        the memory address <strong>0x10040000</strong> and
        <strong>BLE_HeartRate_ota</strong> or
        <strong>BLE_p2pServer_ota</strong> application is loaded at the
        memory address <strong>0x10041000</strong>.</p>
        <p>For more details on OTA process please refers to associated
        readme.html.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
