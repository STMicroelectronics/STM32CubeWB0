        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</p></li>
        <li><p>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>BLE_ApplicationInstallManager binary is downloaded at the
        memory address 0x10040000</li>
        <li>BLE_HeartRate_ota binary is downloaded at the memory address
        0x10041000</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Run the example</p></li>
        <li><p>Install and launch ST BLE Toolbox or ST BLE Sensor
        applications on Android or iOS smartphone</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">
        ST BLE Toolbox Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-toolbox/id1531295550">
        ST BLE Toolbox iOS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems">
        ST BLE Sensor Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-sensor/id993670214">
        ST BLE Sensor iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Power on the Nucleo board with the
        BLE_ApplicationInstallManager and BLE_HeartRate_ota
        applications.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can open ST BLE Toolbox application (android device):
        select the HR_xx in the device list, where xx is the 2 last
        digits of the BD ADDRESS.</p></li>
        <li><p>Connect to the selected STM32WB09 device.</p></li>
        <li><p>Scroll right and select either the Heart Rate interface
        or the Over The Air Update Server interface</p></li>
        <li><p>In the Heart Rate interface, HeartRate and energy
        measurement are launched and displayed in graphs, you can reset
        the energy measurement.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Pairing is supported: Button B2 clears the security database
        when the device is not connected. When connected, Button B2 send
        the slave pairing request, here a popup asks you to associate
        your device. You can either bond from the smartphone by clicking
        on Bond Button.</li>
        <li>This example supports switch to 2Mbits PHY, pressing Button
        B1 while connected allows to switch between 1Mbits PHY and
        2Mbits PHY.</li>
        <li>After 60s of advertising, the application switch from fast
        advertising to low power advertising, pressing Button B1 while
        advertising allows to restart fast advertising.</li>
        <li>Pressing button B3 while connected allows to update the
        connection interval.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>In the Over The Air Update Server interface, select the
        STM32WB09 device type</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The STM32WB0 interface offers the choice to download an
        Application Binary or a User Conf Binary</p></li>
        <li><p>Memory mapping is defined as following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>4 KB (sectors 0 and 1) are reserved for the
        BLE_ApplicationInstallManager application</li>
        <li>250 KB (from sector 2 to sector 126) are dedicated to
        BLE_HeartRate_ota application</li>
        <li>the second 250 KB of Flash (from sector 127 to sector 251)
        are dedicated for the new application</li>
        <li>sectors 252 and 253 are dedicated to User Configuration
        Data</li>
        <li>sectors 254 and 255 are reserved for NVM data used by
        Bluetooth Stack.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>When selecting Application Binary the default Address
        offset 0x03F800 is displayed. The download address of the new
        application is then 0x1007F800.</p></li>
        <li><p>When selecting the User Conf Binary, the Address offset
        to choose is the address offset of the configured User
        Configuration Data area defined in the app_conf.h header file
        (default is 0x07E000).</p></li>
        <li><p>With <em>SELECT FILE</em> you can choose the binary of
        the new application or the binary of the User Configuration Data
        to download.</p></li>
        <li><p>After this binary choice, a calculated Number of sectors
        to erase is displayed resulting of the size in sectors of the
        application or the user configuration data to download.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Number of sectors to erase can be forced with a
        specified number by checking <em>Force</em> checkbox,</p></li>
        <li><p>After selecting download icon, the download will
        start.</p></li>
        <li><p>In case of new application download, a reboot on this new
        application is done at the end of the procedure.</p></li>
