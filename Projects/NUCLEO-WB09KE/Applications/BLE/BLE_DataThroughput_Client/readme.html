        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>How to demonstrate Point-to-Point communication using BLE
        component (as GATT server or GATT client).</p>
        <p>The Nucleo board flashed with BLE_DataThroughput_Client
        application acts as GATT Client and can connect and exchange
        data with a nucleo board flashed with BLE_DataThroughput_Server
        application.</p>
        <p>Data transfer via notification from server to client or/and
        write from client to server. Use of a timer that enables to
        calculate the throughput at application level.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This example runs on STM32WB0 devices. Connect the Nucleo
        Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to USB type C to
        ST-LINK USB connector.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable
        file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Use of two nucleo boards</strong></p>
        <p>Two STM32WB0x nucleo boards are used, one central/client
        (flashed with BLE_DataThroughput_Client) and one
        peripheral/server (flashed with BLE_DataThroughput_Server).</p>
        <p>The GATT server board supports a Data transfer service with a
        transmission characteristic that supports notifications.</p>
        <p>The GATT client board supports a Data transfer service by
        writing without response to the GATT server board Reception
        characteristic.</p>
        <p>The board flashed with BLE_DataThroughput_Client is defined
        as GAP central.</p>
        <p>Open a serial terminal on Central and Peripheral side (ST
        Link Com Port, <span class="citation"
        data-cites="115200">@115200</span> bauds).</p>
        <p>At reset application initialization is done.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The peripheral device starts advertising.</li>
        <li>Push B1 on central: the central device scans and
        automatically connects to the peripheral.</li>
        <li>After connection:
        <ul>
        <li>the client starts to search the data transfer service and
        characteristic.</li>
        <li>the client enables the notifications of the transmission
        characteristic.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>On server side when connected:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>B1 starts (blue LED is ON)/stops (blue LED is OFF)
        notification.</li>
        <li>B2 sends L2CAP connection update - toggle 26.25 ms/11.25
        ms</li>
        <li>B3 toggles PHY</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On server side when idle:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>B2 clears the database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On client side when connected:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>B1 starts (blue LED is ON)/stops (blue LED is OFF) write
        without response.</li>
        <li>B2 sends pairing request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On client side when idle:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>B2 clears the database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On client terminal receiving the current notification, the
        number of bytes per second is displayed.</p>
        <p>On server terminal receiving the current write without
        response, the number of bytes per second is displayed.</p>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
