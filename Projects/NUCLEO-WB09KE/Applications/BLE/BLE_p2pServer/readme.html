        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting as BLE peripheral and GATT
        server.</p>
        <p>p2pServer application advertises and waits for a connection
        from either:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>BLE_p2pClient application running on STM32WB0 device</li>
        <li>BLE_p2pRouter application running on STM32WB0 device</li>
        <li>ST BLE Toolbox smartphone application</li>
        <li>ST BLE Sensor smartphone application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once connected, p2pServer can receive write messages from the
        Client and send notifications to it.</p>

        Software environment</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board may be necessary to run
        p2pClient or BLE_p2pRouter application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with p2pServer application with a
        smartphone:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Install and launch ST BLE Toolbox or ST BLE Sensor
        applications on android or iOS smartphone
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">
        ST BLE Toolbox Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-toolbox/id1531295550">
        ST BLE Toolbox iOS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems">
        ST BLE Sensor Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-sensor/id993670214">
        ST BLE Sensor iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Connect to STM32WB0 device, select p2pS_xx device in the
        list, where xx is the 2 last digits of the BD ADDRESS.</li>
        <li>Select the P2P Server interface and click on the LED icon to
        switch On/Off LED1 of the Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Press the Button B1 of the board to notify the smartphone
        application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with p2pServer application with
        another Nucleo board:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Power up p2pClient device next to a p2pServer device.</li>
        <li>On p2pClient device press B1 button: scan is initiated and
        connection is established to the first p2pServer device that is
        found.
        <ul>
        <li>On p2pServer device press B1 button: a GATT notification
        message is sent toward connected p2pClient device and blue LED
        will toggle.</li>
        <li>On p2pClient device press B1 button: a GATT write command is
        sent toward connected p2pServer device and blue LED will
        toggle.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Advertising is stopped after 60s. A click on button B1 allows
        to restart it.</p>
        <p>When not connected, a click on button B2 allows to clear the
        security database.</p>
        <p>Once connected, a click on button B3 allows to update the
        connection interval parameters.</p>
        <p><strong>Multi connection support:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Pressing button B2 while the device is already connected
        starts a new advertising to allow multi-connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
