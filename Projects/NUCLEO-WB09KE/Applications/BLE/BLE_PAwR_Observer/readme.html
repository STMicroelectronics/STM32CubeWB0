        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting as an Observer of a Periodic
        Advertising with Response (PAwR) train. The device is able to
        receive commands from a periodic advertiser and send responses
        back. The used protocol is derived from standard Electronic
        Shelf label profile but it is not fully compliant.</p>
        <p>The device is addressed by using a Group ID and an ESL ID.
        They are statically assigned, for the sake of simplicity (see
        GROUP_ID and ESL_ID in esl_profile.h). GROUP_ID and ESL_ID can
        be defined at project level to change their value (for this demo
        GROUP_ID and ESL_ID must be between 0 and 2).</p>
        <p>The application starts as a simple Peripheral advertising (it
        uses extended advertising, even though legacy advertising is
        still possible). Once a Central gets connected to the
        Peripheral, the Peripheral can receive the Periodic Advertising
        Synchronization Info so that it can synchronize with the
        periodic advertising train and disconnect the link. In
        particular, the device will only synchronize with the PAwR
        subevent corresponding to the group.</p>
        <p>Once synchronized with the PAwR train, the device can receive
        and execute some ESL-like commands.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board is necessary to run
        BLE_PAwR_Broadcaster application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example.</li>
        <li>Optionally, a serial terminal (with settings 921600-8-N-1),
        can be opened to see some info.</li>
        <li>Use another Nucleo board running BLE_PAwR_Broadcaster. The
        Broadcaster will try to connect to the Observer just to pass
        synchronization information.</li>
        <li>Once the BLE_PAwR_Observer has been synchronized, AT
        commands can be sent from the PAwR Broadcaster specifying a
        GROUP_ID and a ESL_ID (defaults values for BLE_PAwR_Observer are
        0, 0)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more info on how to send commands from the PAwR
        broadcaster, see the related documentation.</p>
        <p>When not synchronized with Access Point, after reset/power-up
        or after a loss of synchronization, the board is in advertising
        state for a limited amount of time (15 minutes). After exiting
        advertising state, press button 1 to start advertising
        again.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
