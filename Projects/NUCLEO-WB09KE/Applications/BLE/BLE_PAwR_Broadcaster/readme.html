        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting as a Broadcaster of a Periodic
        Advertising with Response (PAwR) train. The device is able to
        advertise a PAwR train to send and receive data to/from
        addressed device. The used protocol is derived from standard
        Electronic Shelf label profile, even though not fully compliant.
        It acts as an Access Point (AP).</p>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, the device has a defined list of
        Peripheral to connect to, the ESLs. Within ESL commands, each
        ESL is address by a Group ID and an ESL ID. Once connected to
        the Peripheral, the Periodic Advertising Synchronization
        Transfer (PAST) procedure is started to let the Peripheral
        synchronize with the PAwR train, without the need to do an
        energy-intensive scan. Once the procedure is completed, the link
        can be disconnected.</p>
        <p>To control the AP, an AT-like command interface is used. Each
        command ends with &lt;CR&gt;. For this demo &lt;group_id&gt; and
        &lt;esl_id&gt; are limited to a value between 0 and 2. Only for
        &lt;esl_id&gt; there is the possibility to use FF for broadcast
        messages. The following commands are supported. - Ping an ESL:
        <em>AT+PING=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;</em> - LED control:
        <em>AT+LED=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;led_level&gt;</em>
        - where &lt;led_level&gt; can be 0 (off), 1 (on), 2 (blinking) -
        Read battery level:
        <em>AT+BATT=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;</em> - Response is
        given asynchronously with
        <em>+BATT:&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;battery_level&gt;,&lt;status&gt;</em>
        - Select an image:
        <em>AT+IMG=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;img_index&gt;</em>
        - Send a text:
        <em>AT+TXT=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;text&gt;</em> -
        &lt;text&gt; can be a string with maximum 15 characters - Send a
        price:
        <em>AT+PRICE=&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;price&gt;</em></p>
        <p><em>ATE</em> can also be typed to enable local echo.</p>
        <p>An “OK” or “ERROR” is given after a command is received. When
        a response is received from the peer, this is notified on the
        terminal with a string like
        <em>+&lt;RESP&gt;:&lt;group_id&gt;,&lt;esl_id&gt;,&lt;status&gt;</em>.
        Only Ping, Led Control and Read Battery are currently
        implemented on the PAwR observer running on Nucleo board.
        Commands which do not require a response, e.g. LED Control, can
        be sent in broadcast with all the ESLs in the group, by
        specifying ESL_ID 0xFF. Broadcast commands are retransmitted to
        increase reliability.</p>
        <p>For each AT command, an ESL-like command is queued and sent
        as soon as possible.</p>

        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board is necessary to run

        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Open a serial terminal (with settings 115200-8-N-1 and
        &lt;CR&gt; transmission at end of line).</li>
        <li>Reset the board to run the example.</li>
        <li>Run BLE_PAwR_Observer on another Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Once the PAwR Broadcaster has passed the synchronization
        information to the Observer, you can send commands on the
        terminal by specifying the assigned GROUP_ID and ESL_ID
        (defaults values are 0, 0) to:
        <ul>
        <li>just ping the board</li>
        <li>control an LED (on, off, blink)</li>
        <li>read some sensor data</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
