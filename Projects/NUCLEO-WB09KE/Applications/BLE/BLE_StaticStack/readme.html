        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate how to build a Bluetooth stack for a STM32WB0
        device that can be used by an application programmed in a
        separated area of Flash memory. This gives the possibility to
        update only the application, without the need to update the area
        containing the Bluetooth stack.</p>
        <p>Binary folder contains the firmware binary and the symbol
        table required for an application using the BLE Static Stack.
        The BLE stack is built using the following BLE stack
        configuration.</p>

        <p>An application using the BLE Static Stack must enable the
        same BLE features that have been enabled when the BLE Static
        Stack has been built and it must configure the same number of
        radio tasks (CFG_NUM_RADIO_TASKS). If a different set of
        features or a different number of radio tasks is required, the
        BLE Static Stack must be rebuilt with the new configuration.</p>

        <p>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</p>
        <p>To create the library file containing the symbol table used
        by the application, create_sym_lib.exe utility (inside Utilities
        folder) is used as a post-build step. This utility requires GNU
        ARM Embedded Toolchain to be installed and its binary folder to
        be added to the PATH environment variable.</p>
        <p>These are the applications referenced by create_sym_lib.exe:
        - arm-none-eabi-readelf - arm-none-eabi-gcc -
        arm-none-eabi-ar</p>
        <p>Open a Windows Command Prompt and try to invoke those
        commands to check if they are correctly installed.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-customize-and-build"><strong>How to customize and
        build</strong></h3>
        <p>The set of feature supported by the STM32WB0 BLE stack can be
        customized by changing the BLE Stack modularity options in
        app_conf.h. To reduce the footprint, commands can also be
        removed by removing their references from cmd_call_table array
        (in ble_cmd_if.c).</p>
        <p>These are the steps needed to correctly generate the required
        files:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Change MEMORY_FLASH_APP_SIZE in linker options to increase
        (or possibly reduce) the Flash memory area reserved for the BLE
        Static Stack.</li>
        <li>If MEMORY_FLASH_APP_SIZE has been changed, change
        accordingly also RESET_MANAGER_SIZE for C preprocessor (their
        values must be the same).</li>
        <li>Build.
        <ul>
        <li>create_sym_lib.exe utility is called as post build step to
        generate the required library with symbols to be referenced by
        the application.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Take a note of the first available address in RAM (excluding
        CSTACK or HEAP) from map file. (e.g.Â 0x20000270). It has to be
        taken into account when defining MEMORY_RAM_APP_OFFSET inside
        application project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The output files of the projects are: - BLE_StaticStack.hex:
        binary image to be loaded in Flash memory -
        ble_static_stack_sym.a: library with symbol table to be
        referenced by application.</p>
        <p><em>Important</em>: BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack project by
        default uses ble_static_stack_sym.a from BLE_StaticStack\Binary
        directory. After generating the new binary, make sure that its
        symbol table (generated in BLE_StaticStack folder) is referenced
        by the application.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>Refer to BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack example for the steps to
        follow to run the application.</p>
