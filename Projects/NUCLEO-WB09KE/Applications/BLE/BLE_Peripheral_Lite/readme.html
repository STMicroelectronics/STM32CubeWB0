        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate how to communicate with simple Bluetooth LE
        peripheral with minimum activated features. This application
        shows simple Bluetooth LE peripheral operation with
        bidirectional communication with minimalistic device
        configuration flow and Lite service support with minimum needed
        features activation (not including e.g. Tasks Sequencer, Timer
        Server, Low-Power Manager).</p>
        <p>BLE_Peripheral_Lite application advertises and waits for a
        connection from either:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>ST BLE Toolbox smartphone application</li>
        <li>ST BLE Sensor smartphone application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once connected, BLE_Peripheral_Lite can receive write
        messages from the Client and send notifications to it.</p>

        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with BLE_Peripheral_Lite application
        with a smartphone:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Install and launch ST BLE Toolbox or ST BLE Sensor
        applications on android or iOS smartphone
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">
        ST BLE Toolbox Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-toolbox/id1531295550">
        ST BLE Toolbox iOS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems">
        ST BLE Sensor Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-sensor/id993670214">
        ST BLE Sensor iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Once the code (BLE_Peripheral_Lite) is downloaded into the
        STM32WB0 board and executed, the module is initialized.</li>
        <li>The Peripheral device (BLE_Peripheral_Lite) starts
        advertising with data using local name “HELLO!”.</li>
        <li>The green led blinks for each advertising event slowly each
        ~0.5sec.</li>
        <li>The Smart phone application starts scanning.</li>
        <li>Select the “HELLO!” device (containing My Very Own service
        as P2PServer profile) in the list of Smart phone application and
        connect to it. The green led toggles faster.</li>
        <li>Select the P2P Server interface and click on the LED icon to
        switch On/Off LED1 (blue LED of the Nucleo board0).</li>
        <li>Notification is sent from the server (Peripheral device -
        Nucleo board) to the client (Smart phone) every ~1sec.</li>
        <li>When the Peripheral device (Nucleo board) is disconnected,
        advertising is restarted and it is possible to connect to it
        again.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
