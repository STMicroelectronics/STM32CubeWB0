        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>The ANCS (Apple Notification Center Service) demo configures
        a STM32WB0x device as a Notification Consumer. The purpose of
        the ANCS profile, Bluetooth LE Notification Consumer role is to
        give Bluetooth accessories a simple and convenient way to access
        many kinds of notifications that are generated on a Notification
        Provider.</p>
        <p>The BLE_ANCS demo, after the reset, puts the Bluetooth LE
        device in advertising with device name “ANCS_Demo”, and it sets
        the Bluetooth LE authentication requirements for enabling
        bonding. When the device is connected and bonded with a
        Notification Provider, the demo configures the Bluetooth LE
        Notification Consumer device to discover the service and the
        characteristics of the Notification Provider. When the setup
        phase is completed, the Bluetooth LE device is configured as a
        Notification Consumer and is able to receive every notification
        sent from the Notification Provider.</p>
        <p>The Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) is a Bluetooth
        Low Energy (BLE) profile that allows Bluetooth accessories to
        access notifications generated on an iOS device. The ANCS
        profile defines the roles of Notification Provider (NP) and
        Notification Consumer (NC).</p>
        <p>Roles: - Notification Provider (NP): Typically an iOS device
        (iPhone, iPad, etc.). Generates and sends notifications to the
        Notification Consumer. - Notification Consumer (NC): STM32WB0x
        emulate a Bluetooth accessory (e.g., smartwatch, fitness
        tracker). Receives and processes notifications from the
        Notification Provider.</p>
        <h3 id="demo-application-workflow">Demo Application
        Workflow</h3>
        <h4 id="advertising-and-connection">Advertising and
        Connection</h4>
        <p>The NC starts advertising with a specific device name
        (“ANCS_Demo”). The NP scans for advertising devices and
        initiates a connection.</p>
        <h4 id="bonding-and-authentication">Bonding and
        Authentication</h4>
        <p>The NC sets authentication requirements to enable bonding.
        The NP and NC complete the bonding process.</p>
        <h4 id="service-discovery">Service Discovery</h4>
        <p>The NC discovers the ANCS service and its characteristics on
        the NP.</p>
        <h4 id="notification-handling">Notification Handling</h4>
        <p>The NP sends notifications to the NC via the Notification
        Source characteristic. The NC can request detailed information
        about notifications using the Control Point characteristic. The
        NC receives detailed notification data via the Data Source
        characteristic. The NC can perform actions on notifications
        (e.g., dismiss, respond) using the Control Point
        characteristic.</p>
        <h4 id="example-use-case">Example Use Case</h4>
        <p>A smartwatch (NC) receives a notification about an incoming
        call from an iPhone (NP). The smartwatch displays the caller’s
        name and allows the user to accept or reject the call directly
        from the watch.</p>
        <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The ANCS profile provides a standardized way for Bluetooth
        accessories to interact with notifications generated on iOS
        devices. It enhances the user experience by allowing seamless
        access to notifications and enabling actions directly from the
        accessory.</p>
        <h3 id="peripheral-device-initialization">Peripheral Device
        Initialization</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Peripheral device starts by entering discoverable
        mode.</li>
        <li>LED2 blinks, indicating that the board is in advertising
        mode.</li>
        <li>LED3 is on, indicating that the NC board is connected to the
        NP.</li>
        <li>Every time PUSH1 is pressed, each notification stored on the
        device is shown on the terminal one by one, and the user can
        perform a positive or negative action on the selected
        notification.</li>
