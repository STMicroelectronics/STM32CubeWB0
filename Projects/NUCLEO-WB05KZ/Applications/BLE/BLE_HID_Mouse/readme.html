        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>How to use Human Interface Device over GATT profile for a
        mouse as specified by the Bluetooth LE SIG.</p>
        <p>The Nucleo board flashed with BLE_HID_Mouse application acts
        as GAP peripheral.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This example runs on STM32WB0 devices.</li>
        <li>Connect the Nucleo Board to your PC with a USB cable type A
        to USB type C to ST-LINK USB connector.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable
        file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want see debug message, you can open a serial terminal
        on Peripheral side (ST Link Com Port, <span class="citation"
        data-cites="115200">@115200</span> bauds).</p>
        <p>At reset, application initialization is done. - The
        peripheral device starts advertising. - You can connect and pair
        the board with the BLE of a computer or a phone (android or IOS)
        that acts as GAP central. - Now you can see the mouse pointer
        move in the display of your paired computer or phone. This is a
        simulation of mouse movement: every 1 second the pointer move on
        a fixed coordinate.</p>
        <p>When central device disconnects, the BLE_HID_Mouse device
        restart advertising and a reconnection is made.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
