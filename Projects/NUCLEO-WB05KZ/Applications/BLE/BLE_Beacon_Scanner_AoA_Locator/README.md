## __BLE_Beacon_Scanner_AoA_Locator Application Description__

It shows how to receive advertising beacon packets containing Constant Tone Extension data and collect the IQ samples.

### __Keywords__

Connectivity, BLE, BLE protocol, BLE Direction Finding

### __Hardware and Software environment__

  - This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.
  - Connect the Nucleo Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to USB type C to ST-LINK USB connector. 
  - Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board is necessary to run BLE_Beacon_AoA_Tag application.
    
### __How to use it?__

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open the project with your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Place BLE_Beacon_Scanner_AoA_Locator device next to a BLE_Beacon_Aoa_Tag device.
 - The BLE_Beacon_Scanner_AoA_Locator device synchronizes with periodic advertising from BLE_Beacon_Aoa_Tag device and begin receiving periodic advertising packets.
 - The BLE_Beacon_Scanner_AoA_Locator device enables capturing of IQ samples from the Constant Tone Extension of periodic advertising packets and it gets these IQ samples. 
  
### __Notes__
                                            
 - On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are applied:
   - diag_suppress L6312W          (Hide "Empty < type> region description for region < region>" warning)
   - diag_suppress L6314W          (Hide "No section matches pattern < module>(< section>" warning)
   - diag_suppress L6329W          (Hide "Pattern < module>(< section>) only matches removed unused sections" warning)
