        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate how to build an application referencing a
        Bluetooth stack located in a separate area of Flash Memory. In
        this way, it is possible to update the application without the
        need to program the Bluetooth stack.</p>
        <p>This example is derived from BLE_p2pServer and it keeps the
        original functionality. Refer to the documentation of
        BLE_p2pServer for more information.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>There is also the need of either:
        <ul>
        <li>a smartphone (Android or iOS) for ST BLE Toolbox or ST BLE
        Sensor apps, or</li>
        <li>a second STM32WB0 Nucleo board to run p2pClient or
        BLE_p2pRouter application.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>To be able to run the demo, first program BLE_StaticStack
        firmware (BLE_StaticStack.hex from Binary folder) with
        STM32CubeProgrammer.</li>
        <li>Build BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack project with your preferred
        toolchain and load the image into target memory.</li>
        <li>Reset the board to start the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refer to BLE_p2pServer application for more info.</p>
        <p><em>Important</em>: BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack project by
        default uses ble_static_stack_sym.a from Binary directory, which
        contains the symbol table needed to correctly link the
        application to the BLE_StaticStack.hex binary. If application
        does not use the precompiled BLE_StaticStack.hex in Binary
        folder, make sure to use the correct ble_static_stack_sym.a
        file.</p>
        <h3
        id="converting-existing-application-to-use-ble-static-stack"><strong>Converting
        existing application to use BLE Static Stack</strong></h3>
        <p>This section describes the changes that are needed to convert
        an existing application embedding the traditional STM32WB0
        Bluetooth stack library into one using a STM32WB0 Bluetooth
        stack located in a separated area of Flash memory.<br />
        BLE Static Stack and application must share the same stack
        modularity configuration and the same number of radio tasks. See
        BLE_StaticStack to know the configuration used by BLE Static
        Stack. If the application needs a different BLE configuration
        (e.g. a different set of features or a greater number or radio
        tasks), the BLE Static Stack must be rebuilt with the new
        configuration. See README inside BLE_StaticStack for the steps
        to follow to correctly build a BLE_StaticStack project.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Remove stm32wb0x_ble_stack.a and ble_stack_user_cfg.c from
        build list.</li>
        <li>Add ble_static_stack_sym.a as a library. This is a file
        generated after BLE_StaticStack is built.
        <ul>
        <li>BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack uses ble_static_stack_sym.a from
        Binary folder. If BLE_StaticStack is rebuilt, make sure to point
        to the new ble_static_stack_sym.a.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Add a copy of ble_static_stack_calls.c to the project. It
        can be found in BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack\STM32_BLE\App.</li>
        <li>Replace original linker script with the one used by
        BLE_p2pServer_StaticStack, which contains instructions for the
        placement of STATIC_STACK_APP_CALL_TABLE section.</li>
        <li>Take note of the following information from BLE_StaticStack
        project:
        <ul>
        <li>RESET_MANAGER_SIZE and MEMORY_FLASH_APP_SIZE definitions
        (they have the same value)</li>
        <li>first available location in RAM (excluding CSTACK or
        HEAP)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Add the following definitions of symbols for the linker:
        <ul>
        <li>MEMORY_FLASH_APP_OFFSET=X, where X is equal to
        MEMORY_FLASH_APP_SIZE and RESET_MANAGER_SIZE in BLE Static Stack
        (e.g. if MEMORY_FLASH_APP_SIZE=0x2C000, then
        MEMORY_FLASH_APP_OFFSET=0x2C000).</li>
        <li>MEMORY_RAM_APP_OFFSET=Y, where Y is an offset in RAM
        (compared to the base address 0x20000000) pointing to an area
        not used by BLE Static Stack. E.g., if R/W section in BLE Static
        Stack is allocated till address 0x20000270 excluded, set
        MEMORY_RAM_APP_OFFSET at least to 0x270.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
