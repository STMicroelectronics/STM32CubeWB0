        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting as BLE peripheral and GATT
        server.</p>
        <p>BLE_Security_Peripheral application advertises and waits for
        a connection from either: - BLE_Security_Central application
        running on STM32WB0 device</p>
        <p>Pairing with pass key entry method (with fixed pin) and
        bonding are used in this example.</p>
        <p>Once connected, BLE_Security_Peripheral can receive write
        messages from the Central and it will send notifications
        periodically to it.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>Another STM32WB0 Nucleo board may be necessary to run
        BLE_Security_Central application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You can interact with the BLE_Security_Central
        application with another Nucleo board:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Power up the BLE_Security_Peripheral device next to a
        BLE_Security_Central device.</li>
        <li>On the BLE_Security_Peripheral, press the B2 button to clear
        the security DB.</li>
        <li>On the BLE_Security_Central, press the B2 button to clear
        the security DB.</li>
        <li>On the BLE_Security_Peripheral, press the B1 button to start
        the advertising procedure with a one-minute timeout. During
        advertising, LED2 will blink.</li>
        <li>On the BLE_Security_Central, press the B1 button to initiate
        a scan and establish a connection to the first
        BLE_Security_Peripheral device that is found.</li>
        <li>A GATT notification message is sent periodically to the
        connected BLE_Security_Central device, and the LED1 on the
        Central will toggle.</li>
        <li>On the BLE_Security_Central, press the B1 button to send a
        GATT write command to the connected BLE_Security_Peripheral
        device, causing LED1 on the Peripheral to toggle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the BLE_Security_Peripheral, advertising stops after 60
        seconds. Pressing the B1 button restarts it. If the Peripheral
        is connected, pressing the B1 button starts the procedure to
        disconnect from the Central. When the BLE_Security_Peripheral is
        not connected, pressing the B2 button clears the security
        database. Once connected, pressing the B3 button on the
        Peripheral updates the connection interval parameters.</p>
        <p>When the BLE_Security_Central is not connected, pressing the
        B2 button clears the security database. If the Central is
        connected, pressing the B3 button starts the procedure to
        disconnect from the Peripheral. Once connected, pressing the B1
        button on the Central sends a GATT write command to the
        connected BLE_Security_Peripheral device, causing LED1 on the
        Peripheral to toggle.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
