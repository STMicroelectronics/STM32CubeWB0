        Application Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Demonstrate STM32WB0 acting at the same time as both: BLE
        central and peripheral, GATT server and client.</p>
        <p>BLE_p2pRouter application scans to connect to p2pServer
        devices and accept connection of ST BLE Toolbox smartphone app.
        It will route BLE messages received from both side.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>This application runs on STM32WB0 Nucleo board.</li>
        <li>At least another STM32WB0 Nucleo board is necessary to run
        p2pServer application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
        <p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following
        :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Open the project with your preferred toolchain</li>
        <li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target
        memory</li>
        <li>Run the example</li>
        <li>Install and launch ST BLE Toolbox application on android or
        iOS smartphone
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.dit.stbletoolbox">
        ST BLE Toolbox Android</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/st-ble-toolbox/id1531295550">
        ST BLE Toolbox iOS</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Connect to STM32WB0 device, select p2pR_xx device in the
        list.</li>
        <li>Power up to 7 p2pServer devices next to BLE_p2pRouter
        device.</li>
        <li>With a click on B1, BLE_p2pRouter will scan and then connect
        to a p2pServer device surrounding.</li>
        <li>On smartphone interface you can see devices appearing.</li>
        <li>On p2pServer device, a click on B1 sends a notification to
        BLE_p2pRouter.
        <ul>
        <li>this GATT notification message is forwarded to the
        smartphone and displayed on the interface.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>On smartphone interface a GATT write command can be sent to
        selected p2pServer devices, changing led status.
        <ul>
        <li>this write message is sent first to BLE_p2pRouter and then
        routed to its destination. The blue led will toggle on selected
        p2pServer devices.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="notes"><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>On Keil framework, the following compilation setting are
        applied:
        <ul>
        <li>diag_suppress L6312W (Hide “Empty &lt; type&gt; region
        description for region &lt; region&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6314W (Hide “No section matches pattern &lt;
        module&gt;(&lt; section&gt;” warning)</li>
        <li>diag_suppress L6329W (Hide “Pattern &lt; module&gt;(&lt;
        section&gt;) only matches removed unused sections” warning)</li>
        </ul></li>
