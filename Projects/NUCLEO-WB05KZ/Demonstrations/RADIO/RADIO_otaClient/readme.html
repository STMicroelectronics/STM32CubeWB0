        Demonstration Description</strong></h2>
        <p>How to configure client application using proprietary 2.4 GHz
        radio driver for over-the-air firmware upgrade.</p>
        <p>This code runs OTA Client application: receives a new binary
        image of the firmware containing user application from OTA
        server, saves it to flash memory and runs the received
        application. A proprietary protocol implemented at the radio’s
        low-level driver is used for communication between client and
        server. The user app code is located in flash region after
        OTA_client code, a specific TAG in the startup file indicates if
        received firmware is a valid user application and which
        application should run, if OTA client or user application. The
        PB2 button allows users to activate the OTA Client and get new
        image from an OTA Server.</p>
        <p>Two devices are necessary to fully run this demo. Both
        otaServerYmodem and otaServerFixed can be used as the Server
        application. For example, Radio_otaTx and Radio_otaRx projects
        allow to build the required images to be transferred on the OTA
        Client device.</p>
