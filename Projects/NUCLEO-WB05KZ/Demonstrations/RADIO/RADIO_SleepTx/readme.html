        Demonstration Description</strong></h2>
        <p>How to configure a simple TX scenario with sleep
        management.</p>
        <p>This code runs a TX scenario, sending a packet and waiting
        for an acknowledgment (ACK). A burst of packets equal to
        MAX_NUM_PACKET are sent, the last byte of each packet contains a
        sequential number associated to packet number. If RX timeout
        occurs while waiting ACK a timeout counter is incremented, if
        the CRC error occurs, the counter crc_error_counter is
        incremented. The device goes into sleep mode during periods of
        inactivity. At the end of every burst the Packet Error Rate
        (PER) is computed and is printed on the terminal. To implement
        this scenario, the API HAL_RADIO_SendPacketWithAck is used. The
        default callback, HAL_RADIO_Callback, provided to this function,
        defines the radio’s behavior according to the IRQ flags. The
        following callbacks are implemented in user code according to
        the radio driver’s needs: HAL_RADIO_CallbackRcvOk,
        HAL_RADIO_CallbackRcvTimeout and HAL_RADIO_CallbackRcvError. The
        App_PowerSaveLevel_Check callback is used to prevent the device
        from entering sleep mode during UART communication.</p>
        <p>Two devices are necessary to fully run this demo: one with
        the SleepTX image and the other with the SleepRX image.</p>
